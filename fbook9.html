            <h3>Plot Summary</h3>
            <p>The story is set in a bleak, ash-covered world where an unspecified cataclysm has wiped out civilization.
                The air is choked with ash, vegetation is gone, and the few surviving humans resort to barbarity to stay
                alive. Amid this desolation, a nameless father and his son travel southward, seeking warmth and safety.
                <br><br>

                Armed with a pistol and a cart of meager supplies, the pair encounter the remnants of humanity:
                scavengers, cannibals, and desolate ruins. The father teaches his son survival skills while striving to
                protect him physically and morally in a world devoid of order.
                <br><br>

                Their journey is punctuated by moments of tenderness and resilience, as the father encourages his son to
                ‚Äúcarry the fire‚Äù‚Äîa metaphor for hope and goodness. Despite the father‚Äôs worsening health and the
                constant threat of danger, the bond between the two remains unshakable. The novel culminates in a
                poignant conclusion that underscores the fragile persistence of hope, even in the direst circumstances.
