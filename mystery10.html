            <h3>Plot Summary</h3>
            <p>Christine Lucas wakes up every morning not knowing where she is, who she's with, or even what she looks
                like. Due to a traumatic accident, she suffers from amnesia that erases her memory every day when she
                falls asleep. The only person she can rely on is her husband, Ben, who claims to have been caring for
                her for years. Christine has no recollection of their life together, but Ben assures her everything is
                fine.

                However, Christine‚Äôs life begins to change when a neuropsychologist named Dr. Nash starts treating her.
                He reveals to Christine that he has been helping her with her memory through a journal she has been
                keeping. Each day, Christine writes down everything she learns about herself, her past, and her husband.
                As Christine reads her journal, she uncovers shocking truths‚Äîtruths that don‚Äôt match Ben‚Äôs version of
                events. Her memories, as she discovers more about herself, begin to unravel, and Christine must decide
                whom she can trust, as her reality starts to crumble.
