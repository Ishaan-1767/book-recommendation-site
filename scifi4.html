            <h3>Plot Summary</h3>
            <p>Astronaut Mark Watney is part of the Ares 3 mission to Mars. During a violent sandstorm, he is injured
                and presumed dead by his crew, who evacuate the planet, leaving him behind. However, Mark survives and
                finds himself stranded on the red planet with limited supplies and no way to communicate with Earth.
                <br><br>

                Using his skills as a botanist and engineer, Mark sets out to survive by growing food, rationing
                supplies, and finding innovative solutions to life-threatening problems. Meanwhile, back on Earth, NASA
                discovers he is alive and devises a daring plan to rescue him. The novel alternates between Mark's
                first-person journal entries, filled with humor and resilience, and the perspectives of NASA and his
                crew as they work tirelessly to bring him home.

                unyielding spirit.
