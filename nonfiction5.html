                Wilbur and Orville, raised in a family that valued learning and curiosity, were self-taught engineers

                flights on the windy dunes of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. Despite widespread doubt from the public and
                scientific community, the Wright brothers made history on December 17, 1903, with the first controlled,
                sustained flight of a powered aircraft.
