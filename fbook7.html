            <h2>About the Book</h2>
            <p><strong>Jane Eyre</strong> is a classic novel by Charlotte Brontë, first published in 1847 under the pen
                name Currer Bell. The book is a pioneering work of Gothic romance and a powerful exploration of themes
                like independence, morality, and love. It tells the story of a young woman’s journey from a troubled
                childhood to adulthood as she seeks self-respect, equality, and a sense of belonging in a rigid
                Victorian society.

            <h3>Plot Summary</h3>
            <p>The novel follows Jane Eyre, an orphaned girl who endures a harsh upbringing with her cruel aunt and
                cousins at Gateshead. She later moves to Lowood School, an austere charity institution where she forms
                lasting friendships and gains an education.
                <br><br>

                As an adult, Jane becomes a governess at Thornfield Hall, where she meets and falls in love with the
                enigmatic and brooding master of the house, Mr. Rochester. Their relationship is tested by secrets,
                social constraints, and personal sacrifices, especially when Jane discovers the dark truth about
                Rochester's hidden wife, Bertha Mason.
                <br><br>

                Despite her love for Rochester, Jane refuses to compromise her principles and leaves Thornfield. Her

                Rochester under changed circumstances, where they find mutual respect and love on equal footing.
