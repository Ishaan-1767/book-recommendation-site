            <h3>Plot Summary</h3>
            <p>When Jason Jessup, a convicted child murderer, is granted a retrial after 24 years due to new DNA
                evidence, defense attorney Mickey Haller is unexpectedly called upon to prosecute the case. Haller,
                typically known for defending criminals, agrees reluctantly, seeing it as a chance to ensure a dangerous
                man doesn‚Äôt walk free. He assembles a team that includes his ex-wife and prosecutor, Maggie McPherson,
                and his half-brother, seasoned LAPD detective Harry Bosch, to reinvestigate the case.
                <br><br>

                As they prepare for the courtroom battle, unsettling details about Jessup emerge. Released on bail
                during the retrial, Jessup begins displaying erratic and sinister behavior, creating an undercurrent of
                tension. The legal proceedings are a chess game of strategies, lies, and revelations, while Bosch‚Äôs
                dogged investigation outside the courtroom uncovers shocking truths. The story builds to a nail-biting
                climax, challenging Haller‚Äôs belief in the legal system and the fine line between right and wrong.
