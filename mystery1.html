            <h3>Plot Summary</h3>
            <p>The story follows two main protagonists: Mikael Blomkvist, a disgraced journalist, and Lisbeth Salander,

                the disappearance of his niece, Harriet, who vanished 40 years ago under mysterious circumstances. As
                Blomkvist teams up with Salander, the two unravel dark family secrets, corporate corruption, and a
                series of murders linked to the Vanger family. The plot takes readers through a twisted investigation
                involving betrayal, lies, and hidden truths, as Blomkvist and Salander work together to uncover the
                truth.</p>

                detailed writing and the slow unraveling of secrets keep readers engaged, constantly questioning what
                will happen next, while the shocking twists and revelations ensure that the story remains unforgettable.

                "Friendship ‚Äì my definition ‚Äì is built on two things. Respect and trust. Both elements have to be there.
                And it has to be mutual. You can have respect for someone, but if you don‚Äôt have trust, the friendship
                will crumble."
