            <h2>About the Book</h2>
            <p><strong>Atomic Habits</strong> by James Clear, published in 2018, is a transformative guide that
                demonstrates how small, consistent changes—atomic habits—can lead to remarkable results. Grounded in
                scientific research and enriched with real-life examples, the book explores the psychology and
                mechanisms of habit formation. It offers actionable strategies for developing good habits, breaking bad
                ones, and sustaining progress over time.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Plot Summary</h3>
            <p>In Atomic Habits, James Clear delves into the intricacies of habits, explaining how they are formed and
                why they are so powerful in shaping our lives. Clear introduces the concept of the habit loop, which
                consists of four elements: cue, craving, response, and reward. He emphasizes that understanding these
                elements is crucial for creating habits that stick.
                <br><br>

                The narrative is built around four fundamental laws of behavior change. Clear explains how to make
                habits obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying, ensuring they seamlessly integrate into daily
                routines. He offers practical techniques such as habit stacking—linking new habits to existing ones—and
                the two-minute rule, which encourages starting small to build momentum.
                <br><br>

                Clear also highlights the role of identity in habit formation. He argues that the most effective way to
                change behavior is to shift your self-image, focusing not just on achieving goals but on becoming the
                kind of person who embodies those habits. For instance, instead of aiming to “read a book,” you could
                adopt the identity of “a reader.”
                <br><br>

                Throughout the book, Clear weaves in stories of individuals and organizations that have achieved
                extraordinary results by harnessing the power of atomic habits. From Olympic athletes to business
                leaders, their successes illustrate the book’s principles in action.
