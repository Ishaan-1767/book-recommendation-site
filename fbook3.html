            <h2>About the Book</h2>
            <p><strong>Pride and Prejudice</strong> is a romantic novel by Jane Austen, first published in 1813. It is
                one of the most beloved works of English literature, celebrated for its sharp social commentary,
                memorable characters, and timeless exploration of love, marriage, and class. The novel offers a witty

                strong-willed protagonists.</p>

            <h3>Plot Summary</h3>
            <p>The story revolves around Elizabeth Bennet, the intelligent and spirited second daughter of the Bennet
                family, and her interactions with the wealthy and reserved Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. Elizabeth‚Äôs mother is
                determined to marry her daughters off to wealthy suitors, as the family estate is entailed to a male
                heir.
                <br><br>

                Elizabeth initially forms a poor opinion of Mr. Darcy after he insults her at a ball, and her feelings
                are further hardened by the deceitful Mr. Wickham, who falsely portrays Darcy as a villain. Darcy,
                despite his aloofness and pride, becomes enamored with Elizabeth‚Äôs wit and vivacity.
                <br><br>

                Through a series of misunderstandings, revelations, and moments of self-reflection, Elizabeth and Darcy
                confront their own flaws‚Äîher prejudice and his pride. The story culminates in their mutual
                transformation and a heartfelt union that defies societal expectations. Alongside their romance, the
                novel explores other relationships and characters, including the comic Mr. Collins and the conniving
                Lady Catherine de Bourgh.</p>
            <br>
