            <h2>About the Book</h2>
            <p><strong>The Cuckoo's Calling</strong> is a mystery novel written by Robert Galbraith, a pseudonym for
                J.K. Rowling, published in 2013. It is the first book in the Cormoran Strike series, introducing readers
                to the hard-nosed private detective Cormoran Strike and his determined assistant, Robin Ellacott. The
                novel blends elements of classic detective fiction with contemporary issues, offering a fresh take on
                the genre with complex characters and a richly woven plot.</p>

            <h3>Plot Summary</h3>
            <p>The story follows Cormoran Strike, a struggling private investigator with a complicated personal life and
                a dwindling business. His fortunes change when a high-profile case lands in his lap: the apparent
                suicide of model Lula Landry, who fell from her luxury apartment's balcony. The police have ruled it a
                suicide, but Lula‚Äôs brother, John Bristow, believes she was murdered and hires Strike to investigate
                further.
                <br><br>

                Despite his skepticism, Strike takes on the case, with the help of his new assistant, Robin Ellacott,
                who proves to be an invaluable ally. As the investigation progresses, they uncover a web of secrets
                within the world of fashion, celebrity, and wealth. Strike's sharp instincts and gritty determination
                lead him to dark corners of society where nothing is as it seems. The case takes unexpected twists, and
                the answer to Lula's death reveals more about those around her than anyone could have anticipated.
