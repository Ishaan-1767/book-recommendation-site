            <h3>Plot Summary</h3>
            <p>The novel begins with the March family facing financial difficulties while their father serves as a

                other as they grow into adulthood.

                > Meg, the eldest, is practical and nurturing, longing for a traditional family life.
                <br><br>
                > Jo, the spirited and independent second sister, dreams of becoming a writer and defies societal
                expectations for women.
