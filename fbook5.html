            <h3>Plot Summary</h3>
            <p>The story follows 16-year-old Holden Caulfield, who has been expelled from yet another prestigious
                boarding school. Narrated from a mental institution where Holden is undergoing treatment, the novel
                recounts the events that transpired over a few turbulent days in New York City.
                <br><br>

                Disillusioned with the "phoniness" of the adult world, Holden roams the city, encountering a mix of
                sympathetic and unsympathetic characters. He grapples with his feelings about his younger brother
                Allie‚Äôs death, his complicated relationships with his family, and his longing for meaningful human
                connections.
                <br><br>

                Through his encounters‚Äîwith old friends, nuns, prostitutes, and his beloved younger sister Phoebe‚ÄîHolden
                reveals his fears of growing up and his desire to protect the innocence of childhood. His dream of being
                the "catcher in the rye," saving children from falling into the corruption of adulthood, underscores his
                struggle to reconcile his idealism with the realities of life.</p>
