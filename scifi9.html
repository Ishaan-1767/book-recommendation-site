                masterpiece by Alfred Bester, first published in 1956. Often considered one of the greatest works of

            <h3>Plot Summary</h3>
            <p>The story follows Gulliver "Gully" Foyle, an unremarkable and brutish man stranded in space after his
                ship, the Nomad, is attacked. Left for dead by a passing ship, the Vorga, Gully becomes consumed by an
                unrelenting desire for revenge. This singular obsession drives him to survive against all odds and
                transform himself into a cunning, resourceful, and formidable force.
                <br><br>

                In a future where humanity has developed the ability to teleport, or "jaunte," Gully's quest takes him
                across a divided solar system, from decaying industrial slums to the heights of interstellar wealth and
                power. Along the way, he becomes entangled in political conspiracies, technological secrets, and
                encounters with unforgettable characters, including the enigmatic and tragic Jizbella McQueen.
                <br><br>

                As Gully's journey unfolds, his revenge mission expands into a broader reckoning with his own identity
                and humanity's potential. The novel builds to a climactic and thought-provoking finale that questions
                the boundaries of vengeance, morality, and transcendence.
